# Overview

This program will simulate a game of war and track the number of turns it takes to finish the game.

My goal was to determine how long an average game of war would take if x number of people play.

# Development Environment

I used C++ in CodeBlocks to make this program.

# Useful Websites

* [cplusplus](cplusplus.com)
* [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

# Future Work
* I want to add a feature to allow varying deck counts.
* I need to fix a bug that happens when only 2 players are in the game.
